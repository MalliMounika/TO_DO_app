**Title:** **Create a Robust Backend for ToDo Application**

This project involves designing and implementing a comprehensive backend and frontend for a Todo application using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB for the backend, and HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS for the frontend. The backend will include controllers for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) todos.

**Features**
- **Todo Controllers:** Implement controllers for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) todos.
- **Mark as Read:** Implement a feature to mark todos as read/unread.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling mechanisms to ensure the backend remains stable under various scenarios.
- **Validation:** Implement input validation to ensure data consistency and prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
- **Responsive Design:** Implement a responsive design using Tailwind CSS to ensure the application looks great on various devices.


**Technologies Used**
- **Node.js:** Utilize Node.js as the runtime environment for the backend.
- **Express.js:** Leverage Express.js as the web framework for building the backend.
- **MongoDB:** Utilize MongoDB as the NoSQL database for storing todo data.
- **HTML:** Use HTML for structuring and organizing the frontend content.
- **CSS:** Utilize CSS for styling and layout of the frontend.
- **JavaScript:** Leverage JavaScript for adding interactivity to the frontend.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Use Tailwind CSS for building a responsive and customizable design.


**How to Use**
1. *Clone the repository:* Clone the repository to your local machine to access the backend code.
2. *Install dependencies:* Install the required dependencies using npm install or yarn install.
3. *Start the backend:* Start the backend using npm start or yarn start.
4. *Use the application:* Use the application to create, read, update, and delete todos.
5. *Use Postman or cURL:* Use Postman or cURL to test the backend endpoints.
  

**Learning Outcomes**
- *Understanding of Node.js and Express.js:* Gain hands-on experience with Node.js and Express.js for building robust backends.
- *Knowledge of MongoDB:* Understand how to interact with MongoDB for storing and retrieving data.
- *Experience with building RESTful APIs:* Develop skills in building RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.js.
